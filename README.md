## Project Abstract  

**Eco Track** is a next-generation, AI-driven sustainability platform designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools in the metallurgy and mining sectors.  

At its core, Eco Track introduces the industry’s **first Personal Sustainability Agent** — a multilingual, voice-enabled AI system powered by hybrid LLM architectures (Gemini + Groq Cloud).  

This intelligent agent transforms manual data analysis into proactive intelligence, delivering instant strategies for:  
- Reducing environmental impact  
- Optimizing resource efficiency  
- Driving Net-Zero compliance  

By bridging the gap between engineers and decision-makers, Eco Track enables sustainable transformation at every level of the industry.
